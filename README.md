# React TS

Getting setup with React & TypeScript with Webpack.

Includes testing using Jest & Enzyme.

## Add a Component

```shell
npm run g <tag-name>
```

Generate a component & spec file. A tag name can be provided using dash-case.
This is optional; if you do not provide a tag name, you will be asked to. This
value will be converted to `PascalCase` (ie, `my-cmp` becomes `MyCmp`).

## Dev Server

The Webpack Dev Server runs the application in `example`, so place your root
component(s) in the `App.tsx` file in that directory.
